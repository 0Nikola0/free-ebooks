# App made with PyGame for Gutenberg's website
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a bug that if you click on an image, insted of going to the next scene it starts a neverending loop
To prevent this for now i put a simple input() at the end so it will wait for you to enter something before it 
continues with the loop, giving you time to close it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one of my first project done with OOP, if I can improve anything say it freely, any feedback is appreciated.

Requirements:
- Pygame
- IO
- Urllib  

Requirements for the scraper:
- BS4 (Beautiful Soup)
- Requests
